		What is this?
	</h1>
	<div class="center">
		Revsca is a collab dervied from ScratchCiv that is mainly Minecraft, unlike the previous three in the series.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		It is basically ScratchCiv  with a few tweaks.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		If you don't know what Scratchciv is, then in simpler terms, Revsca is basically Minecraft nations
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		fighting with sheer power.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		However, there isn't just war; there is some moments of
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		resource-gathering, building, and playing Minecraft in general.
	</div>
	<h1 id="archetypes">
		Archetypes
	</h1>
	<div class="center">
		Archetypes are basically how a nation behaves.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Diplomacy, economy, freedom, military, and focus on infastucture all contribute to archetypes.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Diplomatic nations are typically friendly towards other nations, and try to stop wars from happening.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Diplomatic nations are pretty safe to be in, but expand less due to them trying to avoid war.
	</div><br>
	<div class="center">
		Economic nations are all for the profit. They gather resources in bulk, then they trade them off for diamonds
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		and other valuables.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		They also sometimes have some of the most massive claims, and they have good bribes (sometimes).
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		However, "hogging" land is a frowned upon practice, so these nations can sometimes get warred.
	</div><br>
	<div class="center">
		Military nations try to conquer the world (or portions of it). They are ruthless.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Because of their high relations with "dumbness", a form of a military power present everywhere,
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		they can be a fun nation to be in.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		However, military nations are typically not very safe to be in; they can sometimes get massively destroyed.
	</div><br>
	<div class="center">
		Infastructure-focused nations are all about design and building. They want their nation to look nice.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		However, infastructure-focused nations can sometimes have less resources, and typically don't have much land.
	</div>
	<h1 id="nation">
		Creating a Nation
	</h1>
	<div class="center">
		If you are reading this, and want to create a nation, you are probably sick of citizenship.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		You want some independence, so you decide to create a nation. Before doing so however, consider some stuff.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		First of all, newer nations typically preform lower on cenuses due to having less resources, being newer, etc.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Second of all, if you end up inactive, then you'll be nuked to death, or you will be deleted for inactivity.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Third of all, you don't get as much of a "community effort".
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		However, it isn't all negatives. Here are some positives.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		First of all, newer nations attract people who want to build up small communities, rather than having nothing to do.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Second of all, if you are sick of a nation's laws, and you can't find any nation with the laws you want, then
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		making a nation is a good way to enforce those laws you want enforced.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		In order to make a nation, you must make a document about it. You have to show your land claims,
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		agree that you've been on the server for at least 2 full (active) days, 
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		and that you have at least one other person willing to join your nation before it is created
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		(citizens that are already citizens of another country do not count here).
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		In addition to this, you must also provide the laws of your nation, and your government type.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		If you are making a nation, then you can claim land, but there are restrictions.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		You have to build some kind of building in the area you want to claim and have a document to claim it,
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		approved by associated government officials, and if that claim doesn't develop enough within a week
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		, then it gets unclaimed. This way, people can't just "hog land" unreasonably.
	</div>
	<h1 id="war">
		Declaring War
	</h1>
	<div class="center">
		Either a nation did a thing you really hate, or you just want to eat nations as if they where breakfast.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		If so, then you might want to declare war. However, war isn't exactly easy.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		In order to declare war, you need to write a document about your war, and have the other nation be aware.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		You also can only attack a nation if at least one member of the nation is online
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		(unless the nation is marked "Inactive").
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		You also CANNOT bed-camp; do not get too close to a person's bed in war.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		There are also limits; you can only throw a maximum of 4 TNT and change/place/break
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		a combined total of 48 blocks (including TNT blocks). 
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		You also need to build an obvious government area with a government building and your flag proudly displayed.
	</div>
	<h1 id="research">
		Do your research!
	</h1>
	<div class="center">
		This guide doesn't have all information you need to make your intial decision about nationality!
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Look around at other nations, see what they have to offer, and evaluate your decision from there. 
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		Also, some players will give some good resources that demonstrate how "good" nations are in each aspect.
	</div>
	<div class="center">
		It is strongly encouraged to do your own research, and to make resources for new players to learn from!
