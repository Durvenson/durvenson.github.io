		So you are considering joining Strangigaium, huh?
	</h1>
	<div class="center">
		Well, we offer an experience where you can either join or make cities. <br>
		We also have a decent amount of biome diversity; we include various forests, deserts, savanas, mountains, etc.<br>
		If you develop your cities enough, and you also have good amounts of resources, then you might get promoted to county leader (with approval from whatever province leader you have). <br>
		Your duty will now be to make sure cities are developing, make sure people are getting resources and encouraging it via trade, etc.<br>
		As time passes, if you develop your county enough, be well-off resource/trade-wise, and show that you are a good enough leader, then you can get upgraded to province leader. Your duty will now be to make sure county leaders are doing their job, to develop culture and theming in cities, etc.<br>
		In addition to your previous leadership, you may also request to lead another country/province, although it is suggested you stick with one in order to not have to direct your management all over the place. Also, it will be unlikely you will even get your role in the first place due to a serious need of active citizens.<br>
		Our capital, Neo-Davua is at 2222, -626, which is only around 8 minutes from spawn (if you take the Azuronia railroad in the Akkadia station, then go to Neo-Davua from there.) There are closer places however (1344, -148 is in Strangigaium and is only 5 minutes away, but only has a small town called "Vejowches".)<br>
		TL;DR Strangigaium is a decently close to spawn nation that offers a system where you can make/join cities in various biomes and if you work hard enough, you can get leveled up to county or province leader. Like such an experience? Then join our nation today! Just ask to join in the Strangigaium Studio, and you will probably get accepted.
